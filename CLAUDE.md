# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this first. Domain terms (cite, talk,
corpus, source type, anchor verse, snippet, view, page-synced, …) are defined in
**`CONTEXT.md`** — use its vocabulary. Hard-to-reverse decisions live in
**`docs/adr/`**; check them before proposing structural changes.

## What this is

A **Manifest V3 Chrome extension** (personal, load-unpacked) that augments the
reader on `churchofjesuschrist.org/study` for any standard-works chapter. One
side panel, two modes:

1. **Translation** — the same chapter in another version: on the Bible from
   **scripture.api.bible** with the user's own key (NIV, NKJV, …), and on any
   standard work in a **Church language** (Spanish, Japanese, …) fetched from
   the site's own content endpoint. A Church language is split into the page
   beside the English by default (the **page split**), not shown in the panel.
2. **Citations** (all standard works) — which talks cite each verse (BYU
   Scripture Citation Index data), in two citation layouts (by verse / by
   source). Talks open inline; the reader supports local highlights.

The panel mirrors the site's theme/font/size, scroll-syncs in Translation
mode, and has configurable width. Personal use only — api.bible + BYU/Church
content are not redistributable, so **never** the Chrome Web Store (ADR-0003).

## Hard rules

- **No build step for the extension.** Plain HTML/CSS/JS, loaded unpacked
  (ADR-0002).
- **Module pattern:** every JS file is an IIFE attaching to the single global
  `__BTX.<name>` (plus `module.exports` for Node validators). The service
  worker stays a *classic* worker (`importScripts`). Content scripts are listed
  in dependency order in `manifest.json`; `options.html` loads shared files via
  `<script src>` first.
- **No secrets/CORS in content scripts.** All api.bible calls go through the
  **service worker**. The citation feature and Church-language text are
  content-script-only (static web-accessible data + same-origin site fetches,
  `credentials: 'omit'`).
- **The site's reader is React's:** only `__BTX.pageSplit` writes into it, and
  only through its layer, id-scoped `<style>` rules and `data-btx-split` on
  `<html>` (ADR-0007).
- **Safe rendering:** never `innerHTML` untrusted text. Translations render
  from IR via `src/content/sanitize.js`; fetched talk HTML goes through the
  allowlist sanitizer in `src/citations/talk-view.js`.
- **Theme/DOM hooks are class-name-agnostic** — read computed styles / stable
  hooks; the site's classes are hashed (ADR-0005).
- **Highlights stay local** — `chrome.storage.local`, never the Church
  account or sync storage (ADR-0004).
- **Settings go through `__BTX.settings`** — never `chrome.storage.sync`
  directly (`validate-settings.js` enforces this).
- **Docs are written for agents.** Before creating or editing `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTEXT.md`, anything under `docs/`, or a module header comment, load
  `/mattpocock-skills:writing-for-agents` and apply it.

## Layout

One line per module: global name + what it owns. Each file's header comment is
its interface doc — read that before its body.

## BYU data facts

- The BYU DBs: `core.53.db` (~44 MB index) + `content.53.db` (~54 MB zlib
  HTML), joined on `TalkID`. Gitignored; in git/LFS history at the "Add BYU
  citation index databases" commit (retrieval recipe in `.gitignore`).
- The build covers all five volumes: ~125.8k cites across 88 shards, verse-keyed
  (ADR-0001) — the ~0.22% of cites with no verse row aren't shown.
- Citation spans: `<span class="citation" id="{citId}">` in talk HTML;
  modern-GC paragraphs carry `uri=".../slug.p21"` deep-link anchors.
- **STPJS markup differs:** citation spans sit in a bottom footnote list
  (`<div class="footnote">N. <span class="citation">…</span></div>`) with body
  markers `<span class="footRef">N</span>`; `stpjsBodyPassage` derives the
  body passage from the matching `footRef`. JoD/GC carry inline spans.
- DB `book.Abbr` == our slug after space→hyphen; the one alias is D&C `sec` →
  `dc` (`ABBR_ALIAS` in the build).
- GC URL transform: `lds.org/ensign/...` →
  `churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/...`; modern entries already store
  full church URLs.

## Build / test / verify

- **Load:** `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → repo root.
- **Translation:** open `nt/john/3`, add an api.bible key via ⚙ options,
  enable versions, pick a default. Church languages: check Spanish + Japanese
  in options, then pick Español on `bofm/alma/5` — the page splits (columns
  once the panel is collapsed, under each verse while it's too narrow);
  `ot/ps/23` shows poetry lines (Spanish) and furigana (Japanese).
- **Citations:** toggle the panel to Citations; verse → source-type group →
  talk reads inline. Also on `bofm/alma/5`, `dc-testament/dc/76`,
  `pgp/moses/1`. In the reader, select text to highlight (click to remove).
- **Regenerate citation data** (BYU DBs in `source-data/`):
  ```
  node --experimental-sqlite tools/build-citation-data.js
  node tools/validate-citations.js
  ```
  `--inspect` first if DB formats may have changed. STPJS snippets alone (no
  DBs): `node tools/rederive-js-snippets.js`.
- **Checks — run all before finishing:** every `node tools/validate-*.js`
  plus `node --test tools/test-talk-source.js` (node:test, no deps); syntax:
  `node --check <file>`. Each validator names the module it covers.
- **Testability rule:** logic lives in a module's pure core (`module.exports`),
  the DOM shell stays thin — new ordering/grouping/label rules go in
  `cit-view-model.js` not `cit-panel.js`; mode/toggle/view-host rules in
  panel.js's pure cores; what a Save may write in options.js's pure core.

## Ownership rules

Who owns what. Mechanism and reasoning live in the module headers and their
validators — go there before changing behaviour.

- **Panel state** (`panelMode`, `panelCollapsed`, `citationView`,
  `sidebarWidth`) has one owner in the reader, `__BTX.panel`, persisted via
  `__BTX.settings`. `panel.HANDLED_KEYS` lists what the panel handles itself
  (incl. read-only `scrollSync`, `citationSourceMark`, `showCitationToggle`,
  and `fontScale`, which the header's stepper also writes);
  `content.js` reads that list — its subscriber skips changes touching only
  those keys, and the panel fires `renderMode` when an external write stales
  its content. The old `chrome.storage.local` `btxPanelMode`/`btxPanelCollapsed`
  keys are migrated once by `panel.init` — nothing else may name them.
- **Options page** writes via `SETTINGS.patch` (never `replace`) so panel keys
  absent from the form survive, and `subscribe`s so an open form adopts panel
  changes (`fillForm(changed)`, skipping fields the user edited since last
  Save). Single-value fields live in one `FIELDS` table (the Church-language
  checklist is one row: its `change` events bubble to the container); the
  api.bible list shares the dirty flag and `fillPlan`.
- **Settings writes** carry a `__btxWrite` tag (how `own` is detected) and
  pass through unknown keys, so a newer version's setting on another machine
  isn't deleted. Sidebar width bounds (280–900) live only in `__BTX.settings`.
- **View host** (`panel.showView({name,key,cache,render})`): same name + same
  key re-mounts the cached container, different key re-renders; one slot per
  name (`translation`, `citations`, `talk` with `cache:false`);
  `showChapter` drops them all. A view *earns* its slot — spinner/error/empty
  render is never cached (`keepView`/`settleView`). The orchestrator names
  views and supplies keys; it holds no panel DOM.
- **Body scroll** has one writer: `panel.js`'s `writeBodyScroll` (via
  `setBodyScroll`). Views ask via `panel.scrollIntoView(target, {clearTop,
  frames})`; placement is the pure `revealTop`. Each view either owns its
  scroll or is page-synced (`viewRestoresScroll`); with `scrollSync` off
  nothing is page-synced. Tracking is 1:1 and instant; only re-alignment after
  a detached user scroll eases — the pure loop (`scrollStep`/`easeRamp`/
  `floorStep`/`carryScroll`/`realignmentDone`) and its constants are
  load-bearing and exercised by `validate-panel-state.js` with the real loop.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` is deliberately not consulted (panel matches the
  browser, not the OS). Call `refreshScrollSync` only where `wantsScrollSync`'s
  inputs move (`applyModeUI`, `applyCollapsedUI`, `hide`, `scrollSync` change).
- **Theme** (`theme.mirror`) owns capture/apply, the launch alignment backoff
  (`nextAlignDelay`, must terminate), which paragraph size to mirror
  (`dominantTextStyle` — most text by char count; a verse selector is the bug,
  #33/ADR-0005), and a `ResizeObserver` on the reading column for the site's
  font-size slider. An apply that changes nothing writes nothing (`sameVars`) —
  otherwise the observer loops. `resolveReadingColumn` is widest-first,
  `resolveReadingContainer` narrowest-first, on purpose. `content.js` only
  calls `refresh()` after `showChapter`.
- **Body text size** has two owners that compose in CSS: `theme.mirror` writes
  `--btx-size`/`--btx-line` (the site's size), the panel writes
  `--btx-size-scale` from `fontScale`, and `panel.css` multiplies them into
  `--btx-body-size`/`--btx-body-line`. Only body text reads those — chips,
  toolbars, header and footer stay fixed px, and the citation list's designed
  size ladder scales off the multiplier alone, not off the site. Panel-handled,
  never a re-render; the clamp and step are `__BTX.settings`' normalizer
  (`applyFontScale` calls `normalize`, it does not re-clamp). Two editors: the
  options slider and the header's A− / A+ stepper, which writes through
  `persist` like every other panel setting. `stepFontScale` is one rule for
  both jobs — where a click lands, and (`null` = nowhere) which button is
  disabled. Every header control shrinks except the buttons, so the row still
  fits at the 280px minimum width.
  `--btx-line` is **always a length** — `theme.lineHeightOf` states even
  `normal` in px — because multiplying a ratio would apply the scale twice.
- **Citation source marking** (`citationSourceMark`: `strip` default | `chip`) is pure
  CSS off `#btx-root[data-btx-source-mark]`; hue set once per `btx-tag-*` /
  `btx-grp-*` (`--btx-src`). Panel-handled, never a re-render.
- **Page split** (`__BTX.pageSplit`) follows Translation mode: `content.js`'s
  `syncSplit` asks the pure `wantsSplit` wherever an input moves (mode, active
  row, chapter, panel closed, settings) and shows or hides; a new chapter
  hides it first. It mounts only once `article#main[data-uri]` is the chapter
  it loaded (the site swaps the whole article on navigation), and lays out
  again on resize of the article or page and on mutations inside the article.
  Columns give way to interlinear while each column would be under
  `MIN_COLUMN_PX`. The panel meanwhile shows the `beside` card. Collapsing the
  panel does not hide the split — it widens it.
- **Reader scroll targets by corpus** live in `CORPUS_PLANS`
  (`talk-source.js`). `findTarget` runs over the *rendered* talk, so it
  depends on talk-view's render contract: ids survive, classes come back
  `btxk-`-prefixed, footnotes carry `data-btx-footnum`. The STPJS body-passage
  rule is stated twice (build vs reader) on purpose — ADR-0006.

## Gotchas

- Highlights anchor to a top-level block `id`, falling back to block index +
  char offsets + quoted text; a shifted block is skipped on re-apply, not
  misplaced.
- Non-Bible URL segments (`bofm`, `dc-testament`, `pgp`) and
  `dc-testament/dc/{section}` are assumed from convention — confirm on a live
  page; `detect.parseLocation` gates on `BOOKS.isKnownBook`.
- SPA navigation is debounced via `currentKey` in `content.js`; panel-initiated
  changes arrive via `renderMode` instead. Reset `currentKey = null` to force a
  re-render.
- Citations filter: `citVM.filterPlan` decides what hides/opens and restores
  pre-filter open state on clear; `cit-panel` mirrors the plan onto
  `[data-btx-uid]` nodes via a capture-phase `toggle` listener.
- Talk reader header is `position:sticky` inside its `.btx-view`; its sticky
  `top` and negative top margin must sum to zero (mechanism in the CSS
  comment); body padding literals live only in `#btx-root`'s
  `--btx-body-pad-top` / `--btx-body-pad-x`.
- The history hook loads `page-hook.js` via `chrome.runtime.getURL` (page CSP
  allow-lists our origin), not inline; the 750ms poll is the fallback.
- The panel pins to `top:0` and mirrors the site toolbar via `--btx-header-h`
  / `--btx-header-bg`; it stays put when the site header expands.
- Commits are unsigned (GitHub shows "Unverified"); author email
  `noreply@anthropic.com`. The git proxy port rotates — retry pushes; clear
  any stale `remote.origin.pushurl`.
