/*
 * The side panel — a deep module that owns everything panel-shaped: its DOM,
 * its state (mode, citation layout, collapsed, width, translatable), the
 * persistence of that state through __BTX.settings, scroll-sync, and
 * drag-to-resize. It is also the *view host*: callers ask for a named view and
 * the panel decides whether to rebuild it or re-mount the one it cached, and
 * it is the only writer of the body's scroll position. The orchestrator
 * supplies chapter context and content; it never sequences panel setters,
 * persists panel state, or holds panel DOM.
 *
 * Interface:
 *   init(handlers)                 build the DOM, adopt persisted state, wire
 *                                  controls; must be awaited before use
 *   showChapter({ title, translatable })  make the panel visible for a
 *                                  chapter (also invalidates every cached
 *                                  view); `translatable` is false when the
 *                                  chapter has no text to show beside it
 *   hide()
 *   effectiveMode()                'translation' | 'citations' — citations is
 *                                  forced on chapters that aren't translatable
 *   citationView()                 'source' | 'verse'
 *   showView({ name, key, cache, render })  mount the named view; see the view
 *                                  host section below. Returns render's result.
 *   scrollIntoView(target, { clearTop, frames })  reveal a node inside the
 *                                  mounted view — near the middle of the body,
 *                                  so the text leading into it is visible, and
 *                                  clear of any sticky chrome the caller
 *                                  declares (instant: callers reveal a target
 *                                  as part of opening a view)
 *   showTranslation(state)         render a translation-mode body state into
 *                                  the mounted view:
 *                                    { kind:'loading', label }
 *                                    { kind:'nokey' }
 *                                    { kind:'error', message, retry }
 *                                    { kind:'content', blocks, copyright, reference, lang, dir }
 *                                    { kind:'beside', label }  the text is split
 *                                      into the page instead (__BTX.pageSplit)
 *                                  (`lang` is the text's BCP 47 tag, if it
 *                                  isn't English — CJK glyphs and hyphenation
 *                                  depend on it; `dir` 'rtl' for Arabic, …)
 *   populateTranslations(list, selectedId)
 *   getRootEl()
 *
 * handlers: { renderMode(mode), onTranslationChange(id), onGear, onClose,
 *   onRetry }. `renderMode` fires whenever the panel invalidated its own body
 *   content (mode toggle, citation-layout toggle, a synced change from another
 *   context); the orchestrator answers by rendering that mode's content.
 *   After showChapter() the orchestrator renders the current effectiveMode()
 *   itself — showChapter never fires events.
 *
 * Body scroll has exactly one owner and one writer. Each view either *owns* its
 * position (Citations, the talk reader: restored on the way back to where it
 * was left) or is *page-synced* (Translation: the page scroll is the source of
 * truth, so it is placed where the page says instead).
 * viewRestoresScroll() is that rule, and it is why scroll-sync and
 * scroll-restore can no longer both write the same body. The `scrollSync`
 * setting is an input to it: with sync off nothing is page-synced, so
 * Translation owns its scroll like everything else — which is why every view
 * records its offset on the way out even when nothing will read it.
 *
 * Every move routes through setBodyScroll, and almost all of them are instant:
 * tracking the page 1:1 is what makes the panel feel like the browser's own
 * scrolling. Exactly one move eases — re-alignment. The user may scroll the
 * panel away from the page (`syncDetached`, detected by isForeignScroll); the
 * panel then leaves it alone until the page scrolls again, and eases it back
 * rather than snapping. Nothing else animates, and the system's reduced-motion
 * preference is deliberately not consulted: the browser scrolls this page
 * smoothly regardless, and the panel matches the browser, not the OS. A reader
 * who wants none of it turns the `scrollSync` setting off: then the page never
 * moves the body at all — no tracking and no re-alignment either.
 *
 * IIFE -> __BTX.panel (ADR-0002). The pure state core below is also exported
 * for Node (tools/validate-panel-state.js); the DOM shell is skipped there.

  // vertical *middle* of the visible body instead, with the lead-in above it.
  //
  // The gap above is a fraction of the body's own height rather than a pixel
  // count, so it holds at any panel width or window height. Slightly above
  // centre: a citation is read forwards, so the text after it deserves the
  // larger half.
  //   targetTop  the target's distance from the top of the scrollable content
  //   viewportH  the body's visible height
  //   maxScroll  the body's scrollable range (scrollHeight - clientHeight)
  //   clearTop   px at the top of the body that must not cover the target —
  //              the talk reader's sticky header. Centring clears it on any
  //              panel taller than about 2.5x the header, but the floor is in
  //              the rule rather than left to those numbers happening to work.
  //
  // Both clamps are intended behaviour, not leftovers: a target too near the
  // start of the content scrolls to the top and sits wherever it falls (no jump
  // and no second scroll to bounce off), and one near the end scrolls to the
  // bottom, where it is still visible. This is also why the range is a
  // parameter and not the shell's business: "as close as possible" is part of
  // the placement rule, so it is decided and tested here. (setBodyScroll clamps
  // again against the *live* range, which is the same clamp a frame later.)
  //
  // A target inside the top clamp is the one case the floor cannot honour: no
  // scroll position lifts content that is already above the fold, so the panel
  // does the only thing left and goes to the top. In the talk reader that never
