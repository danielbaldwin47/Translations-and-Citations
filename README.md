# Bible Translation Side-by-Side + Scripture Citation Index

A Chrome study extension for [churchofjesuschrist.org/study](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study)
that, while you read **any standard-works chapter** (Old/New Testament, Book of
Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price), shows (1) for the Bible, the
**same chapter in other translations** (NRSV, NIV, NKJV, KJV, …) and (2) for every
book, the **General Conference talks, Journal of Discourses sermons, and Teachings
of Joseph Smith that cite each verse** — all in a side panel that blends into the
Gospel Library reader.

**Current version: 0.1.0** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The panel mirrors the site's light/dark/sepia theme, font, and text size, follows
you as you navigate between chapters, scrolls along with the page, and is resizable.

## Features

- **Two modes** in one panel, toggled in the header: **Translation** and
  **Citations** (all books). On the Book of Mormon, D&C and Pearl of Great Price,
  Translation appears once you turn on a Church language; otherwise only
  Citations shows.
- **Translation** — auto-detects the chapter and loads it in your chosen version;
  one at a time, switchable from a dropdown; scrolls proportionally with the page.
- **Church languages** — read the chapter in Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, … (any
  language you check on the options page) beside the English, on **every standard
  work**. By default the page itself splits in two, each verse level with its
  English one (the shorter side leaves space under it); on the options page you
  can have it under each verse instead, or in the panel. On a narrow window it
  shows under each verse until there's room for two columns — collapse the panel
  (») for more. The text comes straight from churchofjesuschrist.org — no key —
  with the chapter heading and summary, poetry lines, and Japanese furigana.
- **Citations** — two layouts, switchable from the panel or the options page:
  **by verse** (each verse a collapsible dropdown with its citation count, talks
  inside grouped by source type — **General Conference**, **Journal of
  Discourses**, **Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith** — newest first, each with
  a context snippet) or **by source** (each talk listed once, grouped by type).
  Sources are marked either with an acronym chip (GC / JoD / JS) or a coloured
  edge on the group — your pick on the options page. A filter box narrows the
  list and restores your open/closed state when cleared.
- **Open sources inline** — clicking a citation opens the talk in the panel with
  the cited passage revealed in context (not pinned to the top): modern General Conference is fetched live from
  churchofjesuschrist.org (with a subtle "Open full talk ↗" link in the header);
  Journal of Discourses / pre-1971 conference / Joseph Smith come from bundled
  offline text.
- **Local highlights** — select text in the talk reader to highlight it; highlights
  are saved on your machine and re-applied when you reopen the talk. Click a
  highlight to remove it. (Not synced to your Church account.)
- **Resizable** — set a width on the options page, or drag the panel's left edge.
- **Scroll-sync, if you want it** — the translation follows the chapter as you
  scroll; scroll the panel yourself and it stays put until the page moves again.
  Turn it off on the options page and scrolling the page never moves the panel.
- **Blends in** — copies the site's resolved colors/fonts via CSS variables, so it
  tracks theme and font-size changes live (no dependence on the site's class names).
- **Caching + rate-limit handling** for translations; citation data is local.
- No build step for the extension — plain Manifest V3, load it unpacked.

## Scripture Citation Index data

The citation feature is powered by data extracted from the BYU "Scripture Citation
Index" app databases (`core.53.db`, `content.53.db`), processed by
`tools/build-citation-data.js` into the compact, web-fetchable bundle under
`src/citations/data/` (~62 MB: 88 book shards covering all standard works, ~125.8k
citations, plus bundled offline text for non-Church-site sources). This is for
**personal study only** (BYU/Church content is not redistributable — another reason
this stays a load-unpacked extension, not a Web Store listing).

The raw app DBs are **not shipped** (they'd bloat the unpacked extension by ~100 MB
and aren't used at runtime). They live in git/LFS history at the commit that added
them, and are expected in the gitignored `source-data/` folder for rebuilds:

```
mkdir -p source-data        # then put core.53.db / content.53.db here
node --experimental-sqlite tools/build-citation-data.js   # reads source-data/ by default
node tools/validate-citations.js
```

## Translation sources

Copyrighted translations (NIV, NKJV, NRSV, ESV, …) can't be bundled, so the
extension uses **[scripture.api.bible](https://scripture.api.bible/)** with **your
own free API key**:

1. Sign up at <https://scripture.api.bible/> (Starter plan — free, personal use).
2. On the free plan you can add **up to 3 copyrighted versions** to your key
   (e.g. NIV, NKJV, NIRV) plus many public-domain ones.

> The options page lists only the **copyrighted versions you added** to your key
> (the free public-domain ones are hidden, since the goal is to compare other
> mainstream translations). Availability depends on what your key is granted —
> NRSV, for example, isn't currently in the api.bible catalog.

## Install (load unpacked)

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the repo folder.
4. Click the extension's **Settings** (or the ⚙ in the panel) and:
   - Choose a provider (api.bible or bible-api.com).
   - Paste your api.bible key and click **Test key**.
   - Check the translations you want, pick a default, and **Save**.
5. Open any Bible chapter, e.g.
   `https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng`.

The toolbar icon toggles the panel; the panel's ⟩ button collapses it to a tab.

## How it works

```
content script  ──messages──►  service worker  ──fetch──►  api.bible / bible-api.com
 (detect chapter,               (owns API key,             (chapter text)
  inject panel,                  caching, rate limits,
  mirror theme,                  normalizes to safe IR)
  sync scroll)   ◄──IR blocks──
```

- The site is a React SPA, so navigation is detected via a history hook +
  `popstate` + a polling fallback (covers strict CSP).
- All network calls go through the **service worker** (which has `host_permissions`),
  avoiding content-script CORS issues and keeping the key out of the page.
- Chapter text is normalized to a small intermediate representation and rendered
  with text nodes only (no `innerHTML`), so there's no XSS surface.

## Project layout

Every JS file is an IIFE attaching to the single global `__BTX.<name>`; the
header comment of each file is its interface doc.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | MV3 manifest (content-script order matters) |
| `src/shared/constants.js` | message types, storage keys, API bases, limits |
| `src/shared/settings.js` | the one owner of synced settings: schema, defaults, normalizers, get/patch/replace, change subscriptions |
| `src/shared/books.js` | LDS-slug maps: 66 Bible (→ USFM/name) + Book of Mormon / D&C / PGP |
| `src/background/service-worker.js` | message router |
| `src/background/api.js` | api.bible + bible-api.com fetch + normalization |
| `src/background/cache.js` | chapter/bibles cache (chrome.storage.local) |
| `src/background/ratelimit.js` | 15/30s + daily request limiting |
| `src/content/detect.js` | chapter detection (all standard works) + SPA navigation |
| `src/content/page-hook.js` | page-world history patch |
| `src/content/theme.js` | theme/font mirroring, incl. live re-align on site theme/font-size changes |
| `src/content/sanitize.js` | safe IR → DOM renderer |
| `src/content/panel.js` | panel state + persistence, DOM, scroll-sync, drag-resize, and the view host that caches views |
| `src/content/content.js` | orchestrator: detect → worker/citations → panel content |
| `src/citations/cit-data.js` | loads shards / sources / gzipped talks |
| `src/citations/cit-view-model.js` | pure citation view-model: ordering, grouping, counts, labels, filter plan |
| `src/citations/cit-panel.js` | DOM adapter over the view-model |
| `src/citations/talk-source.js` | where a talk's text comes from per corpus, and where to scroll in it |
| `src/citations/talk-view.js` | inline talk reader + sanitizer |
| `src/citations/highlights.js` | local select-to-highlight in the reader |
| `src/citations/data/` | generated citation bundle (committed) |
| `src/options/` | settings page (Translations / Citations / Panel cards) |
| `tools/build-citation-data.js` | builds `src/citations/data/` from the BYU DBs |
| `tools/validate-*.js`, `tools/test-talk-source.js` | Node checks, no deps (each names the module it covers) |
| `tools/make-icons.js` | regenerates the icon PNGs |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/adr/` | agent guidance, domain vocabulary, architecture decisions |

## Development

```bash
for f in tools/validate-*.js; do node "$f"; done   # all module checks
node --test tools/test-talk-source.js                # talk-source seam tests
node tools/make-icons.js                             # regenerate icons/*.png
```

No dependencies to install — the checks are plain Node scripts against each
module's pure core (`module.exports`).

After editing files, reload the extension at `chrome://extensions` (and reload the
Gospel Library tab) to pick up changes.

## Notes & limitations

- Verse numbering differs across translations, so the panel does **not** attempt
  per-verse alignment — scroll-sync is proportional, and whole chapters line up.
- api.bible versions are Bible-only (it has no Book of Mormon, D&C, or Pearl of
  Great Price); on those books the dropdown lists only your Church languages.
- Church languages come from an undocumented endpoint of the Church's site
  (`/study/api/v3/language-pages/…`); if it changes, that text stops loading and
  the rest of the panel is unaffected. A language that hasn't published a volume
  says "doesn't have this chapter available".
- Citations are verse-keyed; a tiny fraction of source citations reference a whole
  chapter/section (or front matter) with no verse and aren't listed.
- Highlights are stored locally on this machine (`chrome.storage.local`) — they're
  not synced to your Church account and won't appear on other devices.
- The icons are generated by `tools/make-icons.js`; replace `icons/*.png` with your
  own art if you like.
- Respect each translation's license terms; this tool is for personal study.
